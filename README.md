## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed (latest stable version)

- A Google account for Firebase
- Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leekonjk/ai-study-buddy-2.git
   cd ai-study-buddy-2
   ```

2. **Set up Firebase**
   
   ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: You need to configure your own Firebase project before running the app.
   
   See the detailed setup guide: [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md)
   
   Quick setup using FlutterFire CLI:
   ```bash
   # Install FlutterFire CLI
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   
   # Configure Firebase
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   
   This will generate the necessary configuration files:
   - `lib/firebase_options.dart`
   - `android/app/google-services.json`
   - `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (if building for iOS)

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
